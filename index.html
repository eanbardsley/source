<p>Pseudo-Realm (Posted June 18 2020 3:12 AM)</p>

<p> My guess is that life is brought about by what I like to call a pseudo-realm.</p>

<p> In order to make artificial intelligence that we say is alive (has awareness) it has to pass the Turing test. Alan Turing said if we can make a computer that in a conversation cannot be distinguished by a human, then it is aware. To make such a computer we have to give it an enormous amount of data. For example if I program the computer to say hello when someone says hello to it, then the person when it says hello to it, it will only answer hello, and the person might suspect that it could be programmed. But if I create a vast data bank of possible answers like “scuse me, didn’t hear ya”, or “pretty well how bout you”, or on to about a million possible answers then make a computer routine in its programming that randomly selects one of these millions of answers, then the computer is more likely to pass the test of being alive.</p>

<p> However, I am not satisfied by the during test. For me if the computer has consciousness, it asses the persons personality that asked the question, then answers in terms of what it feels about that person.</p>

<p> The problem with making computers that are aware occurs because we don’t know why or how, in terms of biology, that humans are alive and conscious. Apparently, we know that the coding for humans, which is in triplets, sets of three switches that are either on or off depending on the sequences of adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine in the DNA, and that in computers the coding is in in binary (switches that are either on or off, high voltage or low) are similar ideas to the programming of artificial intelligence and biological life, respectively, but in the case of biological life, we know these triplet codons encode for say hair color, or skin tone, and in computers for say close your browser, or open a new window, but in the case of biological life the codons can encode but we don’t know how in every cell of say, the human body, the DNA and various organelles zip and unzip, replicate and do all of these things as if every cell has a mind of its own. They have not been able to find one; they have looked in the nucleus of cells and there is nothing there, and they know our brains aren’t orchestrating all of this activity, because there are no nerves running from the brain to the interiors of the cells that make us on every level from bones, to organs, to skin,,,</p>

<p>I am beginning to think that the answer may be that we have the various chemical components that make us up, but that they are animated or come to life by a second outside component that does not exist, but that acts on another nonexistent component, to bring us to life. I say this because things come to life when there is an asymmetry. If the weight on both sides of a teeter-totter is the same (symmetric) it does not move (is static), but add more weight to one side than is on the other (asymmetry) and it moves (comes alive).</p>

<p> This may be analogous to the equations of vorticity that predict the lift keeping up an airplane: to make the equations work we have to introduce pseudovorticity, spinning things that don’t exist to make the equation work. In the same way there may be something from the psuedo-realm that makes inanimate matter animate. See the illustrations on the next couple of pages…</>

<p><img src="pseudorealm02.jpg" alt="activation function" width="500"></p>


<p>I would like to suggest that the prebiotic chemistry might have been passed through an activation function that disappeared after life was on its way to evolving. The problem, then, of answering the question of how life began is one of finding the activation function and its mechanism by which it takes prebiotic chemistry and activates it (makes it alive) so it can now self-replicate, and evolve. We assume that as this mechanism activates the molecules, its mechanism depletes as it activates from what is available. In this sense the mechanism is a limiting reactant, so it determines how much material is activated before it depletes completely. Logically, the way to determine what this mechanism is, and how it serves as an activation function is to look for the by products of the reaction that are left over, and from that, deduce its nature. To do this, we have to look for that thing in our knowledge of the Earth’s history that does not make sense. This would be in the faint young star paradox. We know that five billion years ago, when the Earth and Sun first formed, that the sun was 0.7 times its present output and so, the Earth should have been frozen over, yet, we know it was not. That it had water in its liquid phase. Thus something was there that is not present today. That something must have been the mechanism for the activation function that “turned on” prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><img src="activation_function.jpg" alt="activation function" width="500"></p>

<p>I have presented it like this because 1) Life has not been created in the laboratory from scratch 2) New life does not seem to be originating on earth in present times. Therefore, the activation function is probably not present on Earth today and more than likely disappeared, or depleted after activating prebiotic chemistry. Life exists, yet we do not know how prebiotic substances organize into self-replicating systems that evolve. Therefore, we must look for something concerning the Earth that does not make sense. I suggest that would be the young star paradox. If the Earth had water in its liquid phase when it should have been frozen over, then something could have existed then that was a limiting reactant, or something like it, that activated prebiotic substances, in that it was responsible for warming the earth (perhaps a heat retaining substance). Also, we do not know what dark matter is. Could it be the prebiotic material, x? Or, could it even be responsible for the activation function?</p>

<p> We pick up where we left off. The first work was the completion of a cycle. Here begins a new cycle. The first cycle ended with the equations below:</p>

<p><img src="June_12_2020_equation.jpg" alt="the equations" width="500">The Equation (Updated June 12 2020 5:40 AM)</p>

<p>The developments of my theory has paralleled the development of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity remarkably. His theory made use of a little known mathematics, Tensor Calculus, that was developed in Italy by Levi Civita much earlier (29 March 1873 - 29 December 1941) a pupil of its inventor . He needed this mathematics to formulate his theory, but did not know how to use it. He asked his friend, Marcel Grossman to teach it to him. My theory needed a little known calculus as well that was developed in Italy much earlier, when Tullio Volterra created the product integral to solve differential equations in 1871. It was proposed later to be a generalized form of calculus by, get this, people of the name Grossman and Katz. Furthermore, as tensor calculus was a generalization of vector calculus, so is product calculus of classical calculus.</p> 

<p>The need for relativity stemmed from an experiment done on the mountain that forms the northern border of the valley where I live, The San Gabriel Valley, the mountains being the San Gabriel Mountains, the experiment the Michelson-Morely experiment to determine the speed of light in two different directions.</p>

<p>The theory began when my wife and I, she Italian, went to the library at the colleges so she could use the computers to look for a job. I used the computers while she did that, to research mathematics.</p>

<p>At some point I started developing work in the connection between artificial intelligence (AI) and biological life mainly as a way to understand the origins of life. Interestingly, as of recently I have become captivated by the work of Abel and Trevors, who have written a paper on how biological life can evolve by Natural Selection, but the the operating system and programming instructions cannot come into existence by Natural Selection. Abel and Trevors coined these phrases from computer science, AI operating systems and programming languages being parallel to biological life’s triplet codon system at the DNA level.</p>

<p>It turns out that Abel, approaching the origin of life question from a computer science background, is also using a new emerging science to help, called biosemiotics, that uses linguistics, or the study of language in other words to understand the coding nature of life. In other words, the relationships between words might explain the relationships between the chemical components of biological life, in particular, of the coding language.</p>

<p>In a sense, the relationships I am discovering in my theory between molar mass, density, and radius of elements and compounds, since they are mathematically elegant, not only suggest that this could be in a sense the operating systems of AI and Biological life at the most primary level, but that life could be mathematical in structure, in many instances purely algebraic.</p>

<p>I began to look into product calculus, because I had the question in mind, whether I could write the arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and geometric mean all as one equation. Product calculus is based on the geometric mean while classical calculus the arithmetic mean.</p>

<p>Essentially, I found the problem arises that one needs to use a limit operation where the geometric mean is concerned and that the geometric mean is a definition in product calculus, not derived. But, I found that because there are two core AI elements, I could do it with the special case relationships between all these means that exist for n=2. It could actually already be done without limits for any size of n, but required an inverse function operation, which I wanted to remove so I would have an algebraic expression that could be manipulated algebraically.</p>

The paper I refer to by D.L. Abel and J.T. Trevors is Chance and necessity do not explain the origin of life. (Cell Biology International 2004)

Ultimately I feel we cannot speak of biological life without comparing it to some other construct like AI, I feel it is a purpose of biological life (C, N, O, H) to discover the properties of P, B, Si so it can make computing machines ultimately necessary to its survival. I feel artificial intelligence and biological life are mathematical constructs.

For my work on the mathematical structure of biology and its connection to AI see my paper Silicon and Carbon, my paper Bone, or my paper Biological Life and Electricity.

<p> This is the prequel to Bone, where I compared the aspect of biological life that is bone, to artificial intelligence (AI). This work deals with the comparison of biological life to artificial intelligence where the elements with which the former are built (CHNOPS) to the elements with which the latter are built (Si, Ge, P, B, Ga, As) are concerned. It is a purpose of biological life (C, N, O, H) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines which are necessary to its survival.</p>


<p><a href="bone.html">Bone</a></p>
<p> In comparing biological life to artificial intelligence, I find that the instance of bone is the most compelling. It is at this point that I suggest biological life can be taken as a mathematical structure actually using physical aspects of biological life such as molar mass, density, and atomic radii as the values of the variables. Life seems to only present itself this way if we compare it to another construct, like artificial intelligence. The other extraordinary thing is that bone, which is the fundamental framework around which life is built (muscles are attached to it, skin wrapped around it, organs embedded in it) is described by the fundamental framework around which mathematics is built, algebra. Thus, in this paper dedicated to bone, we have all the framework of fundamental mathematics following from it (ratios, proportions, completing the square, quadratic equations, the golden ratio). As we progress to the form built on the skeleton (muscle on bone) we proceed to the next layer of mathematics, calculus, differential equations, and vector calculus). For instance muscle action is like a damped harmonic oscillator in that the force on the muscle in moving a load is proportional the distance it contracts, and the solution of such a differential equation makes use of the fundamental framework of algebra, namely its solutions are obtained by finding the exponents of e with algebra’s quadratic equation or, equivalently, the factorization of a quadratic, or completing the square. More primary to bone are the amino acids and biological elements such as C, N, O, H, which when compared to the AI elements Si, Ge, P,  B, As, Ga, of which aspects such as bone are built, and semiconductor components are built for logic gates in AI, these find their expression in an elegant set of equations I laid out in earlier work (AI Biodesign, 2019) which make use of ratios and proportions, such as the golden ratio (a/b=b/c, a=b+c) which are building blocks to bone’s algebra just as in they are building blocks to things like amino acids, DNA (in the case of biological life) and Si, Ge, P,  B, As, are building blocks to circuit components in AI. The equations that follow on all layers in terms of molar mass, density, and atomic radii, may be of such parallel construct in the need for function in that molar mass, density, and atomic radii, determine the properties of elements and their ensuing compounds. </p>
