<p> An Interesting Story (April 24 2020 1:30 PM)</p>

<p> The need for relativity stemmed from an experiment done on the mountain that forms the northern border of the valley where I live, The San Gabriel Valley, the mountains being the San Gabriel Mountains, the experiment the Michelson-Morely experiment to determine the speed of light in two different directions.</p>

<p>The theory began when my wife and I, she Italian, went to the library at the colleges so she could use the computers to look for a job. I used the computers while she did that, to research mathematics.</p>

<p>I at some point started developing work in the connection between artificial intelligence (AI) and biological life mainly as a way to understand the origins of life. Interestingly, as of recently I have become captivated by the work of Abel and Trevors, who have written a paper on how biological life can evolve by Natural Selection, but the operating system and programming instructions cannot come into existence by Natural Selection. Abel and Trevors coined these phrases from computer science, AI operating systems and programming languages being parallel to biological life’s triplet codon system at the DNA level.</p>

<p>It turns out that Abel, approaching the origin of life question from a computer science background, is also using a new emerging science to help, called biosemiotics, that uses linguistics, or the study of language in other words to understand the coding nature of life. In other words, the relationships between words might explain the relationships between the chemical components of biological life, in particular, of the coding language.</p>

<p>In a sense, the relationships I am discovering in my theory between molar mass, density, and radius of elements and compounds, since they are mathematically elegant, not only suggest that this could be in a sense the operating systems of AI and Biological life at the most primary level, but that life could be mathematical in structure, in many instances purely algebraic.</p>

</p>I began to look into product calculus, because I had the question in mind, whether I could write the arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and geometric mean all as one equation. Product calculus is based on the geometric mean while classical calculus the arithmetic mean.</p>

<p>Essentially, I found the problem arises that one needs to use a limit operation where the geometric mean is concerned and that the geometric mean is a definition in product calculus, not derived. But, I found that because there are two core AI elements, I could do it with the special case relationships between all these means that exist for n=2. It could actually already be done without limits for any size of n, but required an inverse function operation, which I wanted to remove so I would have an algebraic expression that could be manipulated algebraically.</p>

<p>The paper I refer to by D.L. Abel and J.T. Trevors is Chance and necessity do not explain the origin of life. (Cell Biology International 2004)</p>

<p>Ultimately I feel we cannot speak of biological life without comparing it to some other construct like AI, I feel it is a purpose of biological life (C, N, O, H) to discover the properties of P, B Si so it can make computing machines ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p>For my work on the mathematical structure of biology and its connection to AI see my paper Silicon and Carbon, my paper Bone, or my paper Biological Life and Electricity.</p>

<p>It may be that going from artificial intelligence to biological life is like going from lower dimensions to higher dimensions like in going from regular tesslellators to regular solids.</p>

<p> It harkens back to the foundations of calculus and calls upon non-Newtonian calculus. I will refer you to page 38, top of the page. The equation works at p=-1 because though the first factor is raised to positive one, it is negative one in a mirror image reflected space.</p>

<p><a href="silicon_and_carbon.html">Silicon And Carbon</a></p>
<p> This is the prequel to Bone, where I compared the aspect of biological life that is bone, to artificial intelligence (AI). This work deals with the comparison of biological life to artificial intelligence where the elements with which the former are built (CHNOPS) to the elements with which the latter are built (Si, Ge, P, B, Ga, As) are concerned. It is a purpose of biological life (C, N, O, H) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines which are necessary to its survival.</p>


<p><a href="bone.html">Bone</a></p>
<p> In comparing biological life to artificial intelligence, I find that the instance of bone is the most compelling. It is at this point that I suggest biological life can be taken as a mathematical structure actually using physical aspects of biological life such as molar mass, density, and atomic radii as the values of the variables. Life seems to only present itself this way if we compare it to another construct, like artificial intelligence. The other extraordinary thing is that bone, which is the fundamental framework around which life is built (muscles are attached to it, skin wrapped around it, organs embedded in it) is described by the fundamental framework around which mathematics is built, algebra. Thus, in this paper dedicated to bone, we have all the framework of fundamental mathematics following from it (ratios, proportions, completing the square, quadratic equations, the golden ratio). As we progress to the form built on the skeleton (muscle on bone) we proceed to the next layer of mathematics, calculus, differential equations, and vector calculus). For instance muscle action is like a damped harmonic oscillator in that the force on the muscle in moving a load is proportional the distance it contracts, and the solution of such a differential equation makes use of the fundamental framework of algebra, namely its solutions are obtained by finding the exponents of e with algebra’s quadratic equation or, equivalently, the factorization of a quadratic, or completing the square. More primary to bone are the amino acids and biological elements such as C, N, O, H, which when compared to the AI elements Si, Ge, P,  B, As, Ga, of which aspects such as bone are built, and semiconductor components are built for logic gates in AI, these find their expression in an elegant set of equations I laid out in earlier work (AI Biodesign, 2019) which make use of ratios and proportions, such as the golden ratio (a/b=b/c, a=b+c) which are building blocks to bone’s algebra just as in they are building blocks to things like amino acids, DNA (in the case of biological life) and Si, Ge, P,  B, As, are building blocks to circuit components in AI. The equations that follow on all layers in terms of molar mass, density, and atomic radii, may be of such parallel construct in the need for function in that molar mass, density, and atomic radii, determine the properties of elements and their ensuing compounds. </p>

<p>The creator of this website and author of its content compares biological life
   to artificial intelligence. He believes you can't speak about biological life
without speaking about artificial intelligence, that life, especially awareness, can
only be taken relative to another construct, like artificial intelligence.</p>

mineral from archaeological sites: the recrystallization window</a></p>

<p> In his comparison of biological life to artificial intelligence, Ian feels the most interesting connection so
far is in that of bone (at this link: <a href="https://eanbardsley.github.io/aibiodesign/part2.html" > AI and Bone)<a/>. The paper about bone solubilities from archaeological sites (link at header of this post) is a very nice piece of work. It was written by Francesco Berna, Alan Matthews, Stephen Weiner, Journal of Archaeological Science 31 (2004) 867-882</p>

<p> Not only is this paper well written and right on the money where the origin of life mystery is concerned, it is brilliant. It was written by J.T Trevors, and D.L. Abel in Cell Biology International 28 (2004) 729-739</p>
