<p> Essentially I am working on just the inanimate matter used to make AI in this
paper not connecting its elements to the biological elements, which I have already
done in other work. This is a necessary step to first do for the connection between AI
and biological life. Restricting myself to this in this work I have been able to
develop a generalized equation for the different parameters of AI elements. The new
emerging science of biosemiotics, which sees life as a language that is characterized by
linguistics (the study of relationships between words) is having a great deal of success
in approaching the problem of what life is and how it could have got its start. I think
What I am doing here is connected to that field, because I am mathematically approaching the
relationships that exist in artificial intelligence chemistry, biological chemistry, and between
the two. Since the equations are dynamic, and life is dynamic. But semiotics asks from a
linguistic point of view what is meant by dynamic when biologists say life is dynamic. Further,
I am trying to understand biological life by comparing it to artificial intelligence because
I believe one can only understand biological life, especially awareness, by comparing it to
another structure such as artificial intelligence. This I say because of the Turing test, where
Turing said artificial intelligence is aware if you cannot distinguish it from a human if you
have a conversation with both, where both are hidden.

<p> This is the prequel to Bone, where I compared the aspect of biological life that is bone, to artificial intelligence (AI). This work deals with the comparison of biological life to artificial intelligence where the elements with which the former are built (CHNOPS) to the elements with which the latter are built (Si, Ge, P, B, Ga, As) are concerned. It is a purpose of biological life (C, N, O, H) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines which are necessary to its survival.</p>


<p><a href="bone.html">Bone</a></p>
<p> In comparing biological life to artificial intelligence, I find that the instance of bone is the most compelling. It is at this point that I suggest biological life can be taken as a mathematical structure actually using physical aspects of biological life such as molar mass, density, and atomic radii as the values of the variables. Life seems to only present itself this way if we compare it to another construct, like artificial intelligence. The other extraordinary thing is that bone, which is the fundamental framework around which life is built (muscles are attached to it, skin wrapped around it, organs embedded in it) is described by the fundamental framework around which mathematics is built, algebra. Thus, in this paper dedicated to bone, we have all the framework of fundamental mathematics following from it (ratios, proportions, completing the square, quadratic equations, the golden ratio). As we progress to the form built on the skeleton (muscle on bone) we proceed to the next layer of mathematics, calculus, differential equations, and vector calculus). For instance muscle action is like a damped harmonic oscillator in that the force on the muscle in moving a load is proportional the distance it contracts, and the solution of such a differential equation makes use of the fundamental framework of algebra, namely its solutions are obtained by finding the exponents of e with algebra’s quadratic equation or, equivalently, the factorization of a quadratic, or completing the square. More primary to bone are the amino acids and biological elements such as C, N, O, H, which when compared to the AI elements Si, Ge, P,  B, As, Ga, of which aspects such as bone are built, and semiconductor components are built for logic gates in AI, these find their expression in an elegant set of equations I laid out in earlier work (AI Biodesign, 2019) which make use of ratios and proportions, such as the golden ratio (a/b=b/c, a=b+c) which are building blocks to bone’s algebra just as in they are building blocks to things like amino acids, DNA (in the case of biological life) and Si, Ge, P,  B, As, are building blocks to circuit components in AI. The equations that follow on all layers in terms of molar mass, density, and atomic radii, may be of such parallel construct in the need for function in that molar mass, density, and atomic radii, determine the properties of elements and their ensuing compounds. </p>

<p>The creator of this website and author of its content compares biological life
   to artificial intelligence. He believes you can't speak about biological life
without speaking about artificial intelligence, that life, especially awareness, can
only be taken relative to another construct, like artificial intelligence.</p>

mineral from archaeological sites: the recrystallization window</a></p>

<p> In his comparison of biological life to artificial intelligence, Ian feels the most interesting connection so
far is in that of bone (at this link: <a href="https://eanbardsley.github.io/aibiodesign/part2.html" > AI and Bone)<a/>. The paper about bone solubilities from archaeological sites (link at header of this post) is a very nice piece of work. It was written by Francesco Berna, Alan Matthews, Stephen Weiner, Journal of Archaeological Science 31 (2004) 867-882</p>

<p> Not only is this paper well written and right on the money where the origin of life mystery is concerned, it is brilliant. It was written by J.T Trevors, and D.L. Abel in Cell Biology International 28 (2004) 729-739</p>
