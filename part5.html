<p>I would like to suggest that the prebiotic chemistry might have been passed through an activation function that disappeared after life was on its way to evolving.

The problem, then, of answering the question of how life began is one of finding the activation function and its mechanism by which it takes prebiotic chemistry and activates it (makes it alive) so it can now self-replicate, and evolve. We assume that as this mechanism activates the molecules, its mechanism depletes as it activates from what is available. In this sense the mechanism is a limiting reactant, so it determines how much material is activated before it depletes completely.
Logically, the way to determine what this mechanism is, and how it serves as an activation function is to look for the by products of the reaction that are left over, and from that, deduce its nature.

To do this, we have to look for that thing in our knowledge of the Earth’s history that does not make sense. This would be in the faint young star paradox. We know that five billion years ago, when the Earth and Sun first formed, that the sun was 0.7 times its present output and so, the Earth should have been frozen over, yet, we know it was not. That it had water in its liquid phase. Thus something was there that is not present today. That something must have been the mechanism for the activation function that “turned on” prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p>I have presented it like this because 1) Life has not been created in the laboratory from scratch 2) New life does not seem to be originating on earth in present times. Therefore, the activation function is probably not present on Earth today and more than likely disappeared, or depleted after activating prebiotic chemistry. Life exists, yet we do not know how prebiotic substances organize into self-replicating systems that evolve. Therefore, we must look for something concerning the Earth that does not make sense. I suggest that would be the young star paradox. If the Earth had water in its liquid phase when it should have been frozen over, then something could have existed then that was a limiting reactant, or something like it, that activated prebiotic substances, in that it was responsible for warming the earth (perhaps a heat retaining substance). Also, we do not know what dark matter is. Could it be the prebiotic material, x? Or, could it even be responsible for the activation function?</p>
